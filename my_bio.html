            <p><i>If we enjoy the work, we will accomplish it no matter how difficult it is. One day, 
                I'm waiting for that day, when I will feel programming is my passion, my profession. Programming
                is in my blood, in my head, in my vein, in my pain.</i>

                or we should like what we are doing. We like our work only when we enjoy it. to enjoy the work we have to
                 go crazy on it.

             in Thapathali Campus, Kathmandu. My programming journey have been started. I have done some project on website 
             desinging and graphics design. Now I am woking on Machine learning 
                project named <i>Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning</i>. I was able to make cool static website
                for my school in Pyuthan. But I was unable to make dynamic website. The website can be seen in below link-
